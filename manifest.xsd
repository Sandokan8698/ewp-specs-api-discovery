                EWP Discovery Manifest.

                Manifest files are published by EWP Partners and help define relationships
                between EWP Hosts, their developers, clients, HEIs and API Servers.

                Manifest files are usually read by the EWP Registry Service only.

                            A list of HEIs (Higher Education Institutions) that are covered by this host.

                            Enlisting an institution here indicates that the host wants to receive queries
                            regarding this institution and will be able to understand them. If this list is
                            empty then the host is likely to not receive any queries at all.

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the items
                            submitted here, for example if it finds that some institutions are already
                            covered by a different EWP Host. If, for some reason, your items are not being
                            imported, and you're not sure why, please contact the Registry Service
                            maintainers.

                            other EWP hosts.

                            You should have this element present if you intend to perform requests within
                            the EWP Network. However, it's worth noting, that not having it is also valid
                            (if you want your EWP Host to be "server only").

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the
                            credentials submitted here, for example if it finds they do not meet proper
                            security standards. If, for some reason, your credentials are not being

                                        Base64-encoded X.509 certificate. This MAY be a self-signed certificate.

                                        Having self-signed certificates installed in developers' browsers might make
                                        development and debugging significantly easier (it will allow developers to
                                        make EWP requests directly in their browsers). However, it is NOT RECOMMENDED
                                        to use them in production environment.

                                        IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE: If your private key is compromised, you MUST
                                        immediatelly remove all certificates based on this key from your manifest.

                This section describes all APIs implemented by a particular EWP host.

                Please note, that each API can be implemented a multiple number of times.
                Usually, you will have only a single entry for each of your APIs, but there are
                some use cases when serving two or more different versions of the same API is
                desirable. More background and discussion here:

                            just now). Implementing Discovery API is mandatory (hence, this element is a

                        SCHAC identifier of this HEI. As described in the SCHAC documentation for the
                        "schacHomeOrganization" element (e.g. "uw.edu.pl").

                        This attribute is REQUIRED. Manifest authors need to acquire a proper SCHAC
                        identifier for all HEIs they intend to add to their manifest (acquiring them
                        manually is usually quite simple).
